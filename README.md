# Project Title

Pytorch implementation of AHA! an ‘Artificial Hippocampal Algorithm’ for Episodic Machine Learning by Kowadlo, Rawlinson and Ahmed (2019). 

## Getting Started

Use Pipenv to install dependencies and create compatible virtual environment. (https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-python-projects-with-pipenv)

 - Requires Python version >= 3.6


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```


## Built With

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Artificial neural network framework
